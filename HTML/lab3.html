  <h1>Antoine de Saint Exupéry - The little prince</h1>

  <p><a name="00"></a></p>

  <p>TO LEON WERTH</p>

  <p>I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it
    to a grown-up. I have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in the world.
    I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything, even books about children.
    I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs
    cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the
    child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were once children - although
    few of them remember it. And so I correct my dedication:</p>

  <p>TO LEON WERTH WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY</p>

  <h1><a name="01"></a>I</h1>

  <p>Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called
    <i>True Stories from Nature</i>, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of
    a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.

  <p>In the book it said: <em>"Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without
      chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six
      months that they need for digestion."</em></p>

  <p>I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work
    with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number
    One. It looked something like this:</p>

  <img class="center" alt="Hat"
    src="https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/mountain-landscape-picture-id517188688?k=20&m=517188688&s=612x612&w=0&h=i38qBm2P-6V4vZVEaMy_TaTEaoCMkYhvLCysE7yJQ5Q="

  </ul>
  <p>I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing
    frightened them.</p>

  <p>But they answered: <em>"Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"</em></p>

  <p>My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor
    digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I
    made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups
    could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number
    Two looked like this:</p>

  <img class="center" alt="Elephant inside the boa"

    <li>Contacts</li>
    <li>Literatures</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings
    of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead
    to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That is why, at the age of six,
    I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened
    by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never
    understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always
    and forever explaining things to them.</p>

  <p>So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown
    a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very
    useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost
    in the night, such knowledge is valuable.</p>

  <p>In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many
    people who have been concerned with matters of consequence. I have lived a great
    deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, close at hand. And that hasn't
    much improved my opinion of them.</p>

  <p>Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the
    experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would
    try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it
    was, he, or she, would always say:</p>

  <p><em>"That is a hat."</em></p>

  <p>Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests,
    or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge,
    and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased
    to have met such a sensible man.</p>

  <hr>
  <h1><a name="02"></a>II</h1>

  <p>So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I
    had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something
    was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers,
    I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life
    or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.</p>

  <p>The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any
    human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the
    middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened
    by an odd little voice. It said:</p>

  <p><em>"If you please--draw me a sheep!"</em></p>

  <p><em>"What!"</em></p>

  <p><em>"Draw me a sheep!"</em></p>

  <p>I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard. I looked
    carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood
    there examining me with great seriousness. Here you may see the best portrait that,
    later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less charming
    than its model.</p>

  <img class="center" alt="The Little prince"
    src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%8B-%D0%BA%D0%B0-%D1%81%D0%B5%D1%80-%D1%86%D0%B0-%D0%B2-%D1%8E%D0%B1-%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8-%D1%80%D0%B0-%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%B8-60045149.jpg"

    <li>Literatures</li>
  </ul>
  <p>That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's
    career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas
    from the outside and boas from the inside.</p>

  <p>Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my
    head in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from
    any inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly
    among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing
    about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand
    miles from any human habitation. When at last I was able to speak, I said to him:</p>

  <p><em>"But--what are you doing here?"</em></p>

  <p>And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of
    great consequence:</p>

  <p><em>"If you please--draw me a sheep..."</em></p>

  <p>When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it might
    seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I
    took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen. But then I remembered
    how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic and grammar,
    and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw.
    He answered me:</p>

  <p><em>"That doesn't matter. Draw me a sheep..."</em></p>

  <p>But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had
    drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded
    to hear the little fellow greet it with:</p>

  <p><em>"No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor
      is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome. Where I live,
      everything is very small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep."</em></p>

  <p>So then I made a drawing.</p>

  <img class="center" alt="Sick sheep"
    src="https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/taj-mahal-mausoleum-in-agra-picture-id1146517111?k=20&m=1146517111&s=612x612&w=0&h=vHWfu6TE0R5rG6DJkV42Jxr49aEsLN0ML-ihvtim8kk="

  </ul>
  <p>He looked at it carefully, then he said:</p>

  <p><em>"No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another."</em></p>

  <p>So I made another drawing.</p>

  <p>My friend smiled gently and indulgently.</p>

  <p><em>"You see yourself,"</em> he said, <em>"that this is not a sheep. This is
      a ram. It has horns."</em></p>

  <p>So then I did my drawing over once more.</p>

  <p>But it was rejected too, just like the others.</p>

  <p><em>"This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time."</em></p>

  <p>By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking
    my engine apart. So I tossed off this drawing.</p>

  <p>And I threw out an explanation with it.</p>

  <p><em>"This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."</em></p>

  <p>I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:</p>

  <p><em>"That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have
      to have a great deal of grass?"</em></p>

  <p><em>"Why?"</em></p>

  <p><em>"Because where I live everything is very small..."</em></p>

  <p><em>"There will surely be enough grass for him," I said. "It is a very small
      sheep that I have given you."</em></p>

  <p>He bent his head over the drawing.</p>

  <p><em>"Not so small that--Look! He has gone to sleep..."</em></p>

  <p>And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.</p>

  <hr>
  <h1><a name="03"></a>III</h1>

  <p>It took me a long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who asked
    me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from words
    dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me.</p>

  <p>The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane;
    that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me:</p>

  <img alt="The Little prince"

  </ul>
  <p><em>"What is that object?"</em></p>

  <p><em>"That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane."</em></p>

  <p>And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly.</p>

  <p>He cried out, then:</p>

  <p><em>"What! You dropped down from the sky?"</em></p>

  <p><em>"Yes,"</em> I answered, modestly.</p>

  <p><em>"Oh! That is funny!"</em></p>

  <p>And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me
    very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously.</p>

  <p>Then he added:</p>

  <p><em>"So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?"</em></p>

  <p>At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence;
    and I demanded, abruptly:</p>

  <p><em>"Do you come from another planet?"</em></p>

  <p>But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from
    my plane:</p>

  <p><em>"It is true that on that you can't have come from very far away..."</em></p>

  <p>And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time. Then, taking my sheep out
    of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure.</p>

  <p>You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the
    <em>"other planets."</em> I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on
    this subject.
  </p>

  <p><em>"My little man, where do you come from? What is this 'where I live,' of which
      you speak? Where do you want to take your sheep?"</em></p>

  <p>After a reflective silence he answered:</p>

  <p><em>"The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night
      he can use it as his house."</em></p>

  <p><em>"That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you
      can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to."</em></p>

  <p>But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer:</p>

  <p><em>"Tie him! What a queer idea!"</em></p>

  <p><em>"But if you don't tie him," I said, "he will wander off somewhere, and get
      lost."</em></p>

  <p>My friend broke into another peal of laughter:</p>

  <p><em>"But where do you think he would go?"</em></p>

  <p><em>"Anywhere. Straight ahead of him."</em></p>

  <p>Then the little prince said, earnestly:</p>

  <p><em>"That doesn't matter. Where I live, everything is so small!"</em></p>

  <p>And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added:</p>

  <p><em>"Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far..."</em></p>

  <h1><a name="04"></a>IV</h1>

  <p>I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet
    the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house!</p>

  <p>But that did not really surprise me much. I knew very well that in addition to
    the great planets--such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus--to which we have given
    names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has
    a hard time seeing them through the telescope. When an astronomer discovers one
    of these he does not give it a name, but only a number. He might call it, for example,
    <em>"Asteroid 325"</em>.
  </p>

  <p>I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince
    came is the asteroid known as B-612.</p>

  <p>This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was by a Turkish
    astronomer, in 1909.</p>

  <p>On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International
    Astronomical Congress, in a great demonstration. But he was in Turkish costume,
    and so nobody would believe what he said.</p>

  <p>Grown-ups are like that...</p>

  <p>Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator
    made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume.
    So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive
    style and elegance. And this time everybody accepted his report.</p>

  <p>If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number
    for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways. When you tell them that
    you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters.
    They never say to you, <em>"What does his voice sound like? What games does he love
      best? Does he collect butterflies?"</em> Instead, they demand: <em>"How old is he?
      How many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father
      make?"</em> Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about
    him.</p>

  <p>If you were to say to the grown-ups: <em>"I saw a beautiful house made of rosy
      brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof,"</em> they would not
    be able to get any idea of that house at all. You would have to say to them: <em>
      "I saw a house that cost $20,000."</em> Then they would exclaim: <em>"Oh, what a
      pretty house that is!"</em></p>

  <p>Just so, you might say to them: <em>"The proof that the little prince existed
      is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If
      anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists."</em> And what good would
    it do to tell them that? They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a
    child. But if you said to them: <em>"The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612,"</em>
    then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions.</p>

  </ul>
  <p>They are like that. One must not hold it against them. Children should always
    show great forbearance toward grown-up people.</p>

  <p>But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a matter of indifference.
    I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales. I should
    have like to say: <em>"Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a
      planet that was scarcely any bigger than himself, and who had need of a sheep..."</em></p>

  <p>To those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of truth
    to my story.</p>

  <p>For I do not want any one to read my book carelessly. I have suffered too much
    grief in setting down these memories. Six years have already passed since my friend
    went away from me, with his sheep. If I try to describe him here, it is to make
    sure that I shall not forget him. To forget a friend is sad. Not every one has had
    a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer
    interested in anything but figures...</p>

  <p>It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils.
    It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures
    except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from
    the inside, since I was six. I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true
    to life as possible. But I am not at all sure of success. One drawing goes along
    all right, and another has no resemblance to its subject. I make some errors, too,
    in the little prince's height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short.
    And I feel some doubts about the color of his costume. So I fumble along as best
    I can, now good, now bad, and I hope generally fair-to-middling.</p>

  <p>In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something
    that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought,
    perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through
    the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow
    old.</p>

  <hr>
  <h1><a name="05"></a>V</h1>

  <p>As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little prince's
    planet, his departure from it, his journey. The information would come very slowly,
    as it might chance to fall from his thoughts. It was in this way that I heard, on
    the third day, about the catastrophe of the baobabs.</p>

  <p>This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it. For the little prince
    asked me abruptly--as if seized by a grave doubt--<em>"It is true, isn't it, that
      sheep eat little bushes?"</em></p>

  <p><em>"Yes, that is true."</em></p>

  <p><em>"Ah! I am glad!"</em></p>

  <p>I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes.
    But the little prince added:</p>

  <p><em>"Then it follows that they also eat baobabs?"</em></p>

  <p>I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but,
    on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole herd
    of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab.</p>

  <p>The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh.</p>

  <p><em>"We would have to put them one on top of the other,"</em> he said.</p>

  <img alt="Elephans on the planet"

    <li>Literatures</li>
  </ul>
  <p>But he made a wise comment:</p>

  <p><em>"Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little."</em>
  </p>

  <p><em>"That is strictly correct," I said. "But why do you want the sheep to eat
      the little baobabs?"</em></p>

  <p>He answered me at once, <em>"Oh, come, come!"</em>, as if he were speaking of
    something that was self-evident. And I was obliged to make a great mental effort
    to solve this problem, without any assistance.</p>

  <p>Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived--as
    on all planets--good plants and bad plants. In consequence, there were good seeds
    from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants. But seeds are invisible. They sleep
    deep in the heart of the earth's darkness, until some one among them is seized with
    the desire to awaken. Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin--timidly
    at first--to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun. If
    it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow
    wherever it might wish. But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon
    as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it.</p>

  <img alt="Chare of the planet"

  </ul>
  <p>Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little
    prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that planet was infested
    with them. A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if
    you attend to it too late. It spreads over the entire planet. It bores clear through
    it with its roots. And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many,
    they split it in pieces...</p>

  <p><em>"It is a question of discipline,"</em> the little prince said to me later
    on. <em>"When you've finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to
      attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see
      to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when
      they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in
      their earliest youth. It is very tedious work,"</em> the little prince added,
    <em>"but very easy."</em>
  </p>

  <p>And one day he said to me: <em>"You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that
      the children where you live can see exactly how all this is. That would be very
      useful to them if they were to travel some day. Sometimes,"</em> he added, <em>"there
      is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day. But when it is a matter
      of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe. I knew a planet that was inhabited
      by a lazy man. He neglected three little bushes..."</em></p>

  <p>So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet.
    I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist. But the danger of the baobabs
    is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who
    might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve.
    <em>"Children," I say plainly, "watch out for the baobabs!"</em>
  </p>

  <p>My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger for a long time, without
    ever knowing it; and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing.
    The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me.</p>

  <img class="center" alt="Baobabs"

  </ul>
  <p>Perhaps you will ask me, <em>"Why are there no other drawing in this book as
      magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?"</em></p>

  <p>The reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have not been successful.
    When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring
    force of urgent necessity.</p>

  <hr>
  <h1><a name="06"></a>VI</h1>

  <p>Oh, little prince! Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little
    life... For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure
    of looking at the sunset. I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth
    day, when you said to me:</p>

  <p><em>"I am very fond of sunsets. Come, let us go look at a sunset now."</em>
  </p>

  <p><em>"But we must wait,"</em> I said.</p>

  <p><em>"Wait? For what?"</em></p>

  <p><em>"For the sunset. We must wait until it is time."</em></p>

  <p>At first you seemed to be very much surprised. And then you laughed to yourself.
    You said to me:</p>

  <p><em>"I am always thinking that I am at home!"</em></p>

  <p>Just so. Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is
    setting over France.</p>

  <p>If you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the sunset,
    right from noon. Unfortunately, France is too far away for that. But on your tiny
    planet, my little prince, all you need do is move your chair a few steps. You can
    see the day end and the twilight falling whenever you like...</p>

  <p><em>"One day,"</em> you said to me, <em>"I saw the sunset forty-four times!"</em></p>

  <p>And a little later you added:</p>

  <p><em>"You know--one loves the sunset, when one is so sad..."</em></p>

  <p><em>"Were you so sad, then?"</em> I asked, <em>"on the day of the forty-four
      sunsets?"</em></p>

  <p>But the little prince made no reply.</p>

  <h1><a name="07"></a>VII</h1>

  <p>On the fifth day--again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep--the secret of
    the little prince's life was revealed to me. Abruptly, without anything to lead
    up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent meditation on
    his problem, he demanded:</p>

  <p><em>"A sheep--if it eats little bushes, does it eat flowers, too?"</em></p>

  <p><em>"A sheep,"</em> I answered, <em>"eats anything it finds in its reach."</em>
  </p>

  <p><em>"Even flowers that have thorns?"</em></p>

  <p><em>"Yes, even flowers that have thorns."</em></p>

  <p><em>"Then the thorns--what use are they?"</em></p>

  <p>I did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that
    had got stuck in my engine. I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to
    me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious. And I had so little drinking-water
    left that I had to fear for the worst.</p>

  <p><em>"The thorns--what use are they?"</em></p>

  <p>The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it. As for me,
    I was upset over that bolt. And I answered with the first thing that came into my
    head:</p>

  <p><em>"The thorns are of no use at all. Flowers have thorns just for spite!"</em>
  </p>

  <p><em>"Oh!"</em></p>

  <p>There was a moment of complete silence. Then the little prince flashed back at
    me, with a kind of resentfulness:</p>

  <p><em>"I don't believe you! Flowers are weak creatures. They are na&#271;ve. They reassure
      themselves as best they can. They believe that their thorns are terrible weapons..."</em></p>

  <p>I did not answer. At that instant I was saying to myself: <em>"If this bolt still
      won't turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer."</em> Again the little prince
    disturbed my thoughts:</p>

  <p><em>"And you actually believe that the flowers--"</em></p>

  <p><em>"Oh, no!"</em> I cried. <em>"No, no, no! I don't believe anything. I answered
      you with the first thing that came into my head. Don't you see--I am very busy with
      matters of consequence!"</em></p>

  <p>He stared at me, thunderstruck.</p>

  <p><em>"Matters of consequence!"</em></p>

  <p>He looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine-grease,
    bending down over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly...</p>

  <p><em>"You talk just like the grown-ups!"</em></p>

  <p>That made me a little ashamed. But he went on, relentlessly:</p>

  <p><em>"You mix everything up together... You confuse everything..."</em></p>

  <p>He was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the breeze.</p>

  <p><em>"I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman. He has never
      smelled a flower. He has never looked at a star. He has never loved any one. He
      has never done anything in his life but add up figures. And all day he says over
      and over, just like you: 'I am busy with matters of consequence!' And that makes
      him swell up with pride. But he is not a man--he is a mushroom!"</em></p>

  <p><em>"A what?"</em></p>

  <p><em>"A mushroom!"</em></p>

  <p>The little prince was now white with rage.</p>

  <p><em>"The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years. For millions
      of years the sheep have been eating them just the same. And is it not a matter of
      consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns
      which are never of any use to them? Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers
      not important? Is this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentleman's
      sums? And if I know--I, myself--one flower which is unique in the world, which grows
      nowhere but on my planet, but which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite
      some morning, without even noticing what he is doing--Oh! You think that is not
      important!"</em></p>

  <p>His face turned from white to red as he continued:</p>

  <p><em>"If some one loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all
      the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look
      at the stars. He can say to himself, 'Somewhere, my flower is there...' But if the
      sheep eats the flower, in one moment all his stars will be darkened... And you think
      that is not important!"</em></p>

  <p>He could not say anything more. His words were choked by sobbing.</p>

  <p>The night had fallen. I had let my tools drop from my hands. Of what moment now
    was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death? On one star, one planet, my planet,
    the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted. I took him in my arms, and
    rocked him. I said to him:</p>

  <p><em>"The flower that you love is not in danger. I will draw you a muzzle for
      your sheep. I will draw you a railing to put around your flower. I will--"</em>
  </p>

  <p>I did not know what to say to him. I felt awkward and blundering. I did not know
    how I could reach him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him
    once more.</p>

  <p>It is such a secret place, the land of tears.</p>

  <h1><a name="08"></a>VIII</h1>

  <p>I soon learned to know this flower better. On the little prince's planet the
    flowers had always been very simple. They had only one ring of petals; they took
    up no room at all; they were a trouble to nobody. One morning they would appear
    in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully away. But one day, from
    a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come up; and the little prince
    had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any other small
    sprouts on his planet. It might, you see, have been a new kind of baobab.</p>

  <p>The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce a flower. The
    little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge bud, felt at once
    that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it. But the flower was
    not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her
    green chamber. She chose her colors with the greatest care. She dressed herself
    slowly. She adjusted her petals one by one. She did not wish to go out into the
    world all rumpled, like the field poppies. It was only in the full radiance of her
    beauty that she wished to appear. Oh, yes! She was a coquettish creature! And her
    mysterious adornment lasted for days and days.</p>

  <p>Then one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed herself.</p>

  <img alt="The Little prince and the flower"

  </ul>
  <p>And, after working with all this painstaking precision, she yawned and said:</p>

  <p><em>"Ah! I am scarcely awake. I beg that you will excuse me. My petals are still
      all disarranged..."</em></p>

  <p>But the little prince could not restrain his admiration:</p>

  <p><em>"Oh! How beautiful you are!"</em></p>

  <p><em>"Am I not?"</em> the flower responded, sweetly. <em>"And I was born at the
      same moment as the sun..."</em></p>

  <p>The little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest--but
    how moving--and exciting--she was!</p>

  <p><em>"I think it is time for breakfast,"</em> she added an instant later. <em>
      "If you would have the kindness to think of my needs--"</em></p>

  <img alt="The Little princ eis watering the flower"

  </ul>
  <p>And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling-can
    of fresh water. So, he tended the flower.</p>

  <p>So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity--which was, if
    the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with. One day, for instance, when
    she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince:</p>

  <p><em>"Let the tigers come with their claws!"</em></p>

  <p><em>"There are no tigers on my planet,"</em> the little prince objected. <em>
      "And, anyway, tigers do not eat weeds."</em></p>

  <p><em>"I am not a weed,"</em> the flower replied, sweetly.</p>

  <p><em>"Please excuse me..."</em></p>

  <p><em>"I am not at all afraid of tigers,"</em> she went on, <em>"but I have a horror
      of drafts. I suppose you wouldn't have a screen for me?"</em></p>

  <p><em>"A horror of drafts--that is bad luck, for a plant,"</em> remarked the little
    prince, and added to himself, <em>"This flower is a very complex creature..."</em></p>

  <p><em>"At night I want you to put me under a glass globe. It is very cold where
      you live. In the place I came from--"</em></p>

  <p>But she interrupted herself at that point. She had come in the form of a seed.
    She could not have known anything of any other worlds. Embarassed over having let
    herself be caught on the verge of such a na&#271;ve untruth, she coughed two or three
    times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong.</p>

  <p><em>"The screen?"</em></p>

  <p><em>"I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me..."</em></p>

  <p>Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse
    just the same.</p>

  <p>So the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from
    his love, had soon come to doubt her. He had taken seriously words which were without
    importance, and it made him very unhappy.</p>

  <p><em>"I ought not to have listened to her,"</em> he confided to me one day.
    <em>"One never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply look at them and
      breathe their fragrance. Mine perfumed all my planet. But I did not know how to
      take pleasure in all her grace. This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much,
      should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity."</em>

  <p>And he continued his confidences:</p>

  <p><em>"The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything! I ought to have
      judged by deeds and not by words. She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me.
      I ought never to have run away from her... I ought to have guessed all the affection
      that lay behind her poor little strategems. Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was
      too young to know how to love her..."</em></p>

  <h1><a name="09"></a>IX</h1>

  <p>I believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of
    wild birds. On the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order.
    He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes. He possessed two active volcanoes;
    and they were very convenient for heating his breakfast in the morning. He also
    had one volcano that was extinct. But, as he said, <em>"One never knows!"</em> So
    he cleaned out the extinct volcano, too. If they are well cleaned out, volcanoes
    burn slowly and steadily, without any eruptions. Volcanic eruptions are like fires
    in a chimney.</p>

  <p>On our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes. That
    is why they bring no end of trouble upon us.</p>

  <p>The little prince also pulled up, with a certain sense of dejection, the last
    little shoots of the baobabs. He believed that he would never want to return. But
    on this last morning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to him. And when
    he watered the flower for the last time, and prepared to place her under the shelter
    of her glass globe, he realized that he was very close to tears.</p>

  <p><em>"Goodbye,"</em> he said to the flower.</p>

  <p>But she made no answer.</p>

  <p><em>"Goodbye,"</em> he said again.</p>

  <p>The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold.</p>

  <p><em>"I have been silly,"</em> she said to him, at last. <em>"I ask your forgiveness.
      Try to be happy..."</em></p>

  <p>He was surprised by this absence of reproaches. He stood there all bewildered,
    the glass globe held arrested in mid-air. He did not understand this quiet sweetness.</p>

  <p><em>"Of course I love you,"</em> the flower said to him. <em>"It is my fault
      that you have not known it all the while. That is of no importance. But you--you
      have been just as foolish as I. Try to be happy... Let the glass globe be. I don't
      want it any more."</em></p>

  <p><em>"But the wind--"</em></p>

  <p><em>"My cold is not so bad as all that... The cool night air will do me good.
      I am a flower."</em></p>

  <p><em>"But the animals--"</em></p>

  <p><em>"Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish
      to become acquainted with the butterflies. It seems that they are very beautiful.
      And if not the butterflies--and the caterpillars--who will call upon me? You will
      be far away... As for the large animals--I am not at all afraid of any of them.
      I have my claws."</em></p>

  <p>And, na&#271;vely, she showed her four thorns. Then she added:</p>

  <p><em>"Don't linger like this. You have decided to go away. Now go!"</em></p>

  <p>For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower.</p>
